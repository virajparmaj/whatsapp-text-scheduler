# 12 — Roadmap

## Purpose
Provide a practical, repo-specific plan of improvements aligned with current architecture.

## Status
- Last updated: 2026-03-30
- Items below are **proposed next steps** after the recent UX pass.

## Recently completed (current branch/code state)
1. `testSend` IPC contract aligned to `SendResult`.
2. Retry/backoff support added with `max_retries` setting.
3. Recurring missed-run catch-up added for startup/wake.
4. Settings key whitelist enforcement added.
5. Tray runtime, start-at-login sync, single-instance lock, and structured logging added.
6. Baseline automated tests added (scheduler logic, IPC contract/validation, type mapping).
7. App rebranded to WhatTime; DB auto-migrated from legacy app-name paths.
8. `max_retries` control exposed in Settings UI (bounds-clamped 1–10).
9. Theme picker added to Settings (system/light/dark).
10. Dashboard search + sort controls added.
11. Cmd+N keyboard shortcut for new schedule.
12. Conflict detection on create/edit (`schedule:checkConflicts`).
13. Group scheduling support (`RecipientType`, `enableGroupScheduling` setting).
14. `ExtendedScheduleDialog` for quarterly/half-yearly/yearly time config.
15. Developer “Rebuild App” button in Settings.
16. Group send repaired: double-Escape reset + Cmd+F sidebar search with 6-phase structured flow; group catch-up staggered 8s apart; recency guard prevents redundant catch-ups.
17. Bundle optimization: manual chunks (`vendor-react`, `vendor-date-fns`, `vendor-lucide`) in `electron.vite.config.ts`; app icon size reduced.

## Next priority (high impact)
1. Add first-run onboarding checklist (Accessibility, Contacts, WhatsApp readiness, reliability notes).
2. Complete dark theme token set (Tailwind dark overrides across all components).
3. Add diagnostics panel (“why didn’t it send?” with last run details and actionable fixes).

## Better UI (focused improvements)
1. Add global quick actions in header (New, Pause All, Dry-Run All).
2. Add richer log cards (retry chain grouping, copy error details, filter by schedule).
3. Add calendar execution overlays (sent/failed/skipped markers by day).
4. Add compact mode / dense list for heavy schedule volumes.
5. Add full dark theme token set (currently only light tokens are complete).

## Better workflow
1. Add templates/snippets for repeated messages.
2. Add bulk operations (pause/resume/delete multiple schedules).
3. ~~Add guardrails in create flow (conflict warning for same recipient/time).~~ ✅ Done (see completed #12)
4. Add import/export (JSON) with validation + preview before apply.
5. Add undo window for destructive actions (delete schedule, clear logs).

## Sync strategy (phased)
1. **Phase 1 (safe/local):** Manual export/import backups with schema versioning.
2. **Phase 2 (semi-auto):** Optional auto-backup folder (iCloud/Dropbox-compatible file path).
3. **Phase 3 (advanced):** Optional multi-device sync adapter with conflict resolution policy.

## Medium-term engineering
1. Standardize IPC response envelope for typed error handling in UI.
2. Add migration version table + explicit migration files.
3. Add end-to-end smoke tests for scheduler lifecycle (startup/wake/retry paths).
4. Add release checklist automation for packaging validation.

## Long-term options
1. Optional LaunchAgent/background service mode for stronger always-on reliability.
2. Optional signed/notarized distribution workflow for broader sharing.
3. Optional plugin/provider model for additional messaging channels.

## Recommended next steps
1. Convert “Next priority” into tracked issues with acceptance criteria.
2. Build onboarding + diagnostics first (highest user-friction reduction).
3. Start sync with manual export/import before attempting live multi-device sync.
